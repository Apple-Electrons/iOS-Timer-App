# iOS-Timer-App

I wanted to have a simple pomodoro timer that only had the purpose of counting down from 25 minutes. It presents the countdown timer in large text so that it is always visible to me. 

The app has a simple user interface (UI) with only three buttons: play, stop, and restart. Additionally, I added animations to make the app feel more smooth and authentic.
